3) Since high school I have been immersed in the study of programming languages, especially web development and design.
Initially, I wanted to follow the path of a designer,
but I felt that I was getting more programming and I was more interested in this foundation. From the very beginning, like everything I did,
I made about 10 layouts for all the time. Then I started learning JavaScript. 
I tried to write the simplest tasks, all sorts of small projects such as a calculator in js.
More or less understanding of the language went only after a month of self-study, with the help of video and reading the theory itself in learnJavaScript.

4) Mostly I was working with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.
